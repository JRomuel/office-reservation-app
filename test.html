<p>The commercial collaboration will provide a joint offering of the MIRI® TLI with CHLOE EQ™ integrated with the MIRI server. CHLOE EQ™ captures and processes millions of data points per embryo and automatically inputs embryo annotations that are logged into the electronic medical record (EMR). CHLOE EQ™ utilizes this data to provide an embryo quality score, coupled with the biological data and insights to explain the system's data output. CHLOE EQ™'s automated capabilities provide embryologists with previously unachievable data to support consistent and standardized embryo selection decision support. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"After a rigorous assessment of the available AI support solutions to improve IVF outcomes, it was clear that Fairtility provided the most comprehensive offering," said&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">Dr.&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Sanjay Bhojwani</span>, Director and Global Head, Sales and Marketing, of Esco Medical</span>. "The transparency of CHLOE EQ™'s analysis maximizes the impact of our time-lapse embryo image capture with AI-driven insights supported by clear biological data. We believe the combination of these two technologies will improve the standard of care through automation and increased transparency for both IVF professionals and patients."</p>
<p>CHLOE EQ™ 's transparent AI allows embryologists to reduce time spent on manual annotation by an average of 33 percent per cycle, resulting in up to a 50 percent increase of availability in fertility clinics. With an increased capacity for IVF cycles per embryologists, IVF clinics can make treatments available to more patients, while reducing embryologist burnout.</p>
<p>"Esco's MIRI® TLI empowered with CHLOE EQ™ can ease the workflow of embryologists, increase accuracy and streamline communication between IVF practitioners, clinic staff and prospective parents.", said&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;"><span class="xn-person">Eran Eshed</span>, CEO and Co-Founder of Fairtility.</span>&nbsp;"The operational and clinical efficiency enabled by our complementary technologies is a step forward in meeting the growing demand of family building needs."</p>
<p class="mb-5">Esco Medical, a leading manufacturer of high-quality Assistive Reproductive Technology (ART), selected CHLOE EQ™ to augment the capabilities of its multi-room time-lapse incubator, MIRI® with transparent AI-derived embryo quality assessments. The choice to implement CHLOE EQ™ exclusively is a result of conclusive evidence-based research in the quality and reliability of Fairtility's technology.</p>
